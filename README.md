# HPC Project Code

This repositry contains the code produced for the High Performance Computing project looking at Parallel Molecular Dynamics with Short Ranged Potentials.

Molecular dynamics models use the Lennard-Jones potential, and use Verlet integration.

## Serial Code

The serial code is contained in the notebook Molecules_better.ipynb, where we will indicate where variables can be updated.

## Parallel Full Model

The full parallel code used is contained in the folder Parallel_Code. How to run this code is explained in that folder.

## Parallel Lattice Model
